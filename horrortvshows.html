               Just like stormy gloomy days, the history of horror is a vast and perhaps foolhardy thing to tackle. No matter how hard you try, there are films and horror subgenres that will slide through the cracks. But horror is somewhat unique among the film genres in that there is a recognizable pattern that happens again and again. A film will come along and terrify an audience capturing their imaginations and making bank- Filmmakers flock to the cash cow like vampires to blood which leads to sequels and imitators – sometimes better than the original. But eventually the sequels run out of steam and the subgenre created by the original smash hit fades into memory lurking in the corners of history waiting to be rediscovered and reborn- this process is commonly referred to as cycles. Although other genres behave similarly, the unique appeal of horror from its low budget requirements to broad multinational appeal, make horror especially susceptible to these boom and fade cycles. But as we look at how the genre changes over time, we must not think of the history of horror as being a rigid one way street. New films borrow from old films all the time, a constant remix of subgenres and new techniques to make. something for the contemporary culture.
               Next there's a list of the best horror TV shows of all time and how they have evolved.
               
               
                </p>
                
                
                <h1>Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955-1962)</h1>

                <p>The creepy theme song, the striking silhouette, the slowly, slyly delivered "Good eve-eee-ning" — when Alfred Hitchcock migrated from the big screen to the small in order to make a weekly series, his personal brand was the main attraction. In addition to using his hosting gig to become an embodiment of horror (a characterization Tippi Hedren would no doubt find appropriate), Hitch further honed his directorial skills on nearly 20 of the series' episodes, garnering two Emmy nominations. But perhaps the show's' greatest contribution to the genre was Hitchcock's use of much of its crew — cheaper hires than the usual Hollywood suspects — to shoot a little movie called Psycho.</p>
                
               
               <h1> Dark Shadows (1966-1971)</h1>

               <p>Supernatural soaps of all stripes can all trace their roots back to Barnabas Collins, the vampire (played by Jonathan Frid) who made Dark Shadows a bright spot on the daytime dial. He didn't even show up on the series until 1967, a year into the atmospheric ABC soap's five-year run, but after being unchained from a coffin, his arrival transfixed the show's young-skewing viewers. From then on, the afternoon serial went from a mildly Gothic story to a full-fledged paranormal romance, mixing witchcraft and werewolves into its sudsy storylines about lost love. It's now the definition of a cult classic.</p>
                
                <h1> Night Gallery (1969-1973)</h1>

                <p>You've already defined speculative, intellectually complex genre TV for a generation of viewers. What do you do for an encore? If you're Rod Serling, the answer is simple: You tap into psychological horror and double down on the darkness. The TV auteur's Nixon-era series presented short, sharp, scary vignettes (as many as four per episode) that were fueled by murder, guilt, revenge, hauntings, undead predators, and the untapped powers of the mind. By adapting works by such weird-fiction godfathers H.P. Lovecraft, August Derleth, Clark Ashton Smith, and Fritz Leiber, Serling further made the case for his own legendary status. And did we mention that Steven Spielberg made his directorial debut in the pilot?</p>
                
                <h1>Tales from the Crypt _1989-1996</h1>

                <p>Tales from the Crypt, sometimes titled HBO's Tales from the Crypt, is an American anthology horror television series that ran from June 10, 1989 to July 19, 1996, on the premium cable channel HBO for seven seasons with a total of 93 episodes. The title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name and most of the content originated in that comic or the six other EC Comics of the time (The Crypt of Terror, Haunt of Fear, Vault of Horror, Crime SuspenStories, Shock SuspenStories, and Two-Fisted Tales). The show was produced by HBO with uncredited association by The Geffen Film Company and Warner Bros. Television (all part of a production consortium officially called Tales from the Crypt Holdings).
                Because it was aired on HBO, a premium cable television channel, it was one of the few anthology series to be allowed to have full freedom from censorship by network standards and practices. As a result, HBO allowed the series to contain content that had not appeared in most television series up to that time, such as graphic violence, profanity, sexual activity, and nudity</p>
                
                <h1>The X Files (1993-2002</h1>
                
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHFWAXvPctI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                
                <p>This show was a confluence of the creepy and conspiracy thriller, mixing monsters, an alien invasion and a government cover-up ("The truth is out there") . Two FBI agents - paranormal believer Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and skeptic Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) - investigate unsolved cases deemed too weird by the FBI. Over the course of nine seasons and two feature films, Mulder and Scully faced mutants, sewer creatures, a killer doll (in an episode written by Stephen King), The Smoking Man and a criminal faction of the government known as The Syndicate. In the process, it consistently delivered scares and developed a cult following. While only seasons 4-6 cracked the top 20, The X-Files deserves credit for helping FOX expand its brand beyond comedies, lite soaps (Beverly Hills 90210) and COPS. Also, the theme song was featured on the seminal 1994 CD, Pure Moods, which alone would earn it a place on this list.

                    <h1>Buffy, The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003</h1>

               <p>High school is literally hell on earth — beat that for a high concept! The genius of Joss Whedon's star-making series was taking a metaphor for adolescent angst, giving it fangs, and handing its heroine a wooden stake. Buffy Summers and her Scooby Gang faced down more than their fair share of menaces from beyond, but like Twin Peaks before it, Buffy realized that great horror was rooted in human experience; the death of Buffy's mother was as harrowing as TV has ever gotten, with nary a demon in sight. That said, there are few more nightmarish TV moments than watching the "gentlemen" of the show's "Hush" episode float by, silently smiling as they steal voices and hearts. Some of you might be shouting "Buffy's not horror!" Which only speaks to the show's brilliance, since it transcends all genres. It's drama, it's action, it's light comedy and it's soap. We're throwing it into the horror category since the persistent theme is fighting vampires, demons and other associated undead, so that sort of outweighs the rest. We can certainly reap the accolades that made it a critical darling, cult hit and go-to for binge watching - smart, well plotted, sharply written and action-packed. But the true standpoint is Buffy herself - one of TV's first kick ass heroines who had complexities and insecurities that made her far from one-dimensional.

                <h1>Supernatural (2005-Present</h1>

                <p>This show is still going strong after nine seasons, with no plans to slow down (there's even a backdoor spin-off being written in towards the end of Season 9). That longevity alone earns it a place on this list. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki star as the Winchester brothers, Dean and Sam, who track and destroy the minions of evil, make pacts with the devil, get sucked to hell, hang with demon witches and more, all while driving in their '67 Impala. The show has built a rich, diverse mythology while always keeping the relationship between the brothers front and center. Its also not afraid to use comedy - something that can be surprisingly effective in horror, at times.</p>
                
                <h1>The Walking Dead (2010-Present</h1>

                <p>In its original form, as a zombie comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard, The Walking Dead was the little series that could: an independent, black-and-white horror story that slowly but surely eclipsed all but the biggest full-color corporate superhero comics in popularity. As a television show, TWD's success has been almost as unlikely. It started, courtesy of Shawshank Redemption director Frank Darabont, as horror's stab at a prestige drama worthy of sharing AMC airtime with Mad Men; several showrunners and tens of millions of viewers later, it's a ratings juggernaut that showcases man's inhumanity to man with at least as much gory gusto as the cannibalistic attacks of the undead</p>

                    Ryan Murphy's FX series has been a showcase for some of the most treasured tropes horror has to offer as a visual genre — killer clowns, demonic nuns, haunted hotels, you name it. But every carnival needs its barkers, and Murphy has hired a murderers' row of actresses to fill that role, from Kathy Bates to Emma Roberts, Glenn Close to Lady Gaga. And in an era where the big-screen's genre offerings are still driven by found-footage minimalism, AHS's more-is-more attitude is a throwback to the days of the Grand Guignol. It's horror for the animated-GIF era.
                    The so-called “Golden Age” of television of the last decade (The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Mad Men) revitalized many genres, and AHS marked horror’s turn (along with The Walking Dead). Ryan Murphy’s slick, sophisticated show has self-contained seasons and a recurring troop of A-list talent (Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Zachary Quinto). Equal parts macabre and bizarre, the show is intensely watchable while offering frights. Perhaps its greatest strength lies in its ability to quickly oscillate between the “what the hell is going to happen next?” to “what the hell just happened?” For instance, the it-never-gets-old-clip-below:
                </p>
